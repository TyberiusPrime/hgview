temporary TODO list :

 - manage group of users and save config in $HOME/.hgviewrc or $HGDIR/.hgviewrc

   - assign a color to each group instead of each user/email

 - diff for merges currently takes only the first parent

 - investigate how to speed up for large repo (ie linux kernel)

 - highlight search string in the lists (revision and file lists)
