NAME
----
hgview - Qt based mercurial repository browser

SYNOPSIS
--------
'hgview' [filename]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

hgview(1) is a GUI application usually invoked from the command
line. The simplest way to use it is to install it as a hg
extension. Alternatively, it can be used as a standalone application
by calling it from a mercurial repository.

If [filename] is given, hgview will start in file-diff mode, in which
user can easily compare arbitrary revisions of a file.

FILES

    extensions. See `hg qv-config` for more details on what can be
    configured this way.

    patches in the hg repository. See `hg qv-config` for more details
    on what can be configured this way.

BUGS
----
