hgqv intallation notes
======================

hgqv can be used either as a hg extension, or as a standalone
application.

It depends on:

- mercurial (1.0 minimum)
- PyQt4
- QScintilla and PyQScintilla
- mx.DateTime

It is very simple to use ``hgqv`` from the hg repository::

  hg clone http://www.logilab.org/hg/hgqv
  
  cd <ANY_HG_REPO>
  $PATH_TO_HGQV_DIR/bin/hgqv

On the other hand, installing ``hgqv`` is simply done using usual
``distutils`` script::

  cd $PATH_TO_HGQV_DIR
  python setup.py install

Last, you can add the following to your main .hgrc file::

  [extensions]
  qtview=path/to/hqgv/qtview.py

  [qtview]
  # your hgqv configs statements like: 
  dotradius=6
  # type hg qv-config to list available options
